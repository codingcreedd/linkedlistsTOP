Linked List Implementation

This repository implements a linked list data structure in JavaScript.
What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic in size and do not require contiguous memory allocation. This makes them efficient for operations like insertion and deletion, but less efficient for random access.
